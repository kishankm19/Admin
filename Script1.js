Very simple and effective… Thanks!
But i have a follow-up question. How should we code success.html, such that it will refuse to show, if the user skips javascript_login.html, and goes directly to success.html?

In other words, how do we authenticate if the user browsing success.html has actually provided authenticated, or even authorized credentials? Is there a simple way to do this? I find Owin and stuff very complicated.
